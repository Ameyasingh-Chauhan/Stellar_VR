  # STELLAR VR - Full Project


  This archive contains a FastAPI backend and a React frontend (Vite) for converting 2D videos into VR180 stereoscopic MP4.


  See `backend/README` and `frontend/README` sections in the top-level README in the project for run instructions.


  Quick start (local):
- Ensure ffmpeg & ffprobe are installed and on PATH
- Backend: install requirements in backend/ and run uvicorn
- Frontend: npm install in frontend/ and run `npm run dev`
